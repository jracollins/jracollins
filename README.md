## About

Hi! I'm James, a full-stack software engineer/SRE based in the UK. Rust, JS, Kubernetes and Terraform are my tools of choice.

Currently market-making/HFT crypto markets as a personal project (Over 1.1bn USD traded), but also interested in new opportunities, feel free to contact me if applicable on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jracollins).
